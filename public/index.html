            <p>
                I'm a first-year Ph.D. student in the department of Information Science at Cornell University, based in
                NYC
                at
                Cornell Tech. I work with Deborah Estrin, Nicola Dell and many others on the design and development of
                technologies that improve wellbeing for underserved communities. Specific problems that compel me
                include
                the
                potential for language processing methods to change how we conceptualize mental & behavioral wellbeing,
                the
                need
                for technology design frameworks that work for and not in spite of marginalized people, and the
                possibilities of
                privacy-preserving machine learning.
            </p>
            <p>
                I earned a B.A. from Princeton University and an M.S. from Cornell Tech. In previous lives I made radio,
                print
                and multimedia journalism, developed mathematical models for disease spread and ran early-stage product
                development at a tech startup. I've also worked as a healthcare consultant in the U.S. and taught
                software
                engineering. Drop me a line -- I'm always interested in meeting new people.</p>
